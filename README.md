# FPGA-Based Accelerator for the L-BFGS Algorithm in 3D Face Reconstruction

We utilize FPGAs to develop a high-throughput hardware accelerator of the Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimization algorithm used in FaceScape algorithm. The accelerator design mainly targets two general components: a general-purpose L-BFGS computation module, primarily comprising the SDU and LSU, and a specialized Objective Function Unit (OFU) with a Gradient Calculation Unit (GCU) tailored for 3D face reconstruction. Additionally, we log the runtime at each step to facilitate the comparison of hardware acceleration across different modules.

## Benchmarking

We select 330 face images from the FaceScape dataset as the testing data for evaluation. Please note that the results were obtained using an Intel i7-12700 processor with a 64-bit operating system. Performance may vary with different hardware setups, potentially yielding better or worse results. Therefore, the results should be used as a reference rather than an absolute measure.

## Purpose of the Code

This code replaces the L-BFGS algorithm in the bilinear model fitting stage of the original FaceScape project with a detailed step-by-step implementation. The original algorithm directly employed SciPy’s implementation. By exposing the inner workings of this algorithm, we can observe the computation time at each step. Additionally, for a clearer comparison of software and hardware performance, we also implement the accelerated component of our hardware design in optimized C language and compile it using GCC.
